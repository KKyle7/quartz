# Experimental Design

- Briefly put, it's being able to connect data effectively
- The goal is to test a hypothesis typically by using the meaningful data from the experiments
  - Involves planning, carrying out, and analyzing experiments
- Then we make decisions using the data
  - We often want to predic the future
  
- Some things to consider
  - Minimizing time, costs and mistakes
  - Maximizing data


# Components of Experimental Design

- There isn't a set format or steps to follow
- There are things you should have in an experimental design
  - Problem/research quesiton
  - Variables (confounding, independent, dependent)
  - Sample size/population
  - Hypothesis
  - Data collection method
- We answer the question: "Given some set of options, which option should we choose to  maximize my optimization criteria"
  - Optimization criteria: the objective we want to achieve based on predefined criteria
  - Remember that maximize can also mean decrease
    - Like decrease the costs of this project

Note: AB testing is when you compare 2 versions to see which one is more appealing to people

## Important Terms

- Control group: the group that experiences no change
- Treatment group : the group that exepriences change you want to test
- Variable: any characteristic that is recorded in a study
- Dependent variable: what we measure
- Independent variable: what we manipulate

**Did you know**: Multiple independent variables may influence each other (making them technically independent variables and unwilling dependent variables at the same time)
- This can complicate the interpretation of results
- You want to minimize the presence of correlated (independent) variables

## Hypothesis

- A testable explanation/statements that addresses the question
  - Typically written in the format "if the hypothess is right, then something should be true"
- Null hypothesis is the default statement where you assume there is no correlation
  - You want to typically disprove or rejec the null hypothesis

## Confounder Variables

- A variable that you did not account for/manipulate that could influence results
- There are a few ways you can account for this
  - Control - use of control/treatment groups
  - Randomization - randomize groups to make them more representative and reduce bias
    - If there are confounding variables among the population, hopefully it'll be distributed equally across both groups
  - Replication - repeat experiment to assess consistency and reliability
    - Can also help identify confounding factors the more time you do it

## Data collection methods

- Observational studies: observe but don't intervene
  - Cross sectional studies
    - collect data from many individuals at the same time
    - a snapshot in time
  - Retrospective (case control) studies
    - look into the past, sometimes literally just by looking, other times by doing investigations into past events/experiences to identify exposure
    - Then compare it to the known outcome (since it already happened), and analyze the relationship
  - Prospective (longitudinal/cohort) studies
    - Follow people (cohort) over a long time
- Surveys: collection info through questions
- Experiments: actively change things to see what happens
- Simulations: create fake scenario to model the real world for data collection
  - When real life is too expensive, dangerous, or impractical

### Placebo Effect

- Belief in treatment fools you into thinking that you actually got the treatment and thus you actually improve
- Typically for experiments


### Blinding
- Not telling the participants and/or researchers who got what treatment
- May prevent placebo effect or researchers' bias
