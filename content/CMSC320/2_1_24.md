# Kinds of data

- There are 2 types of data, each with different subtypes
  - Quantitative
    - Discrete
    - Continuous
  - Qualitative
    - Structured
    - Unstructured

# Ways to represent data
## Structured
- Tabular data (tables)
  - Structured
- Text
  - Human-readable
- Graphs
  - Represents relationships using nodes and edges
- Time series
  - Any kind of data related to time

## Unstructured (raw data)
- Videos
- Images
- Audio
- Biometrics
- Haptics

# Data formats
- CSV (comma separated values)
  - plain-text format where data values are separated by commas
  - usually used for tabular data
- TSV (tab-separated values)
  - also used for tabular data
  - values are separated tabs

CSV readers should typically be able to take in any file that uses any separator character (not just commas)

- Images
  - encompasses the visual content ad properties of an image
  - Properties include:
    - Pixel structure
      - Images are really just mini blocks (pixels)
    - Pixel data
      - Each pixel holds color information
    - Color Channels (3 of them)
      - Each pixel has 3 color channels (layers)
      	- Red
	- Green
	- Blue
    - Channel Values
      - Each color channel ranges from 0 (no intensity) to 255 (max intensity
    - Intensity Values
      - By varying intensity, you can create different shades

- Compressed images
  - Lossy
    - Sacrifices data to reduce file size
    - For things like JPEG, minor quality loss is acceptable
  - Lossless
    - Reduces file size without any loss of quality
    - Ideal for preserving image quality in things that require high resolution
    - For things like PNG, GIF, medical imaging

- Database
  - Organized collection of structured data
  - Efficiently manages and allows retrieval, updating, and manipulation of info
