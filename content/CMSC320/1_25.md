# What is data science and why do we care?

- We want to take raw data and turn it into insights about the world or predctions about the future

# What is big data?
<p style="text-align: center;">Center Test</p>

Big data describes datasets with large ==volume==, created and updated with high ==velocity==, that have ==variety== in structure and format. As more companies and organizations collect and use big data, the demand for people with data science skills grows.

## Volume
- The amount of data generated or collected
- Increased exponentially in recent time

## Velocity
- The speed the data is generated, processed, and analyzed

## Variety
- Big data comes in a variety of forms
  - Tables
  - Spreadsheets
  - Images
  - Videos
  - Sound
  - Text


# Data life cycle
- Systemic steps that outline what we do with data
- Define the problem statement -> Data collection -> data processing -> exploratory analysis and data visualization -> Analysis of hypothesis, testing, and machine learning -> insight and policy decision
- It's not actually a linear process as you may need to backtrack, or skip steps, or backtrack and skip steps
  - This is because you may need to revisit previous steps due to new insights or challenges that arise during later stages

### Define the Problem Statement
- Have a research objective that you can realistically aim for

### Data collection
- A systemic approach to gather relevant info from a variety of sources
  - External sources
  - Existing company databases
  - Measurements that you did
- Sources can be broken down into 2 types
  - Primary data
    - **Problem**: when there is a unique problem and no related research done on it
    - **Solution**: collect new data
    - **Includes**: surveys, labs, web analytics
    - **Issues**: time consuming
  - Secondary data
    - **Problem**: Some proble and the data is readily avaialble or collected by someone else
    - **Solution**: use the data
    - **Includes**: published articles


### Data processing
- A quality check to make sure the data is good
- Need this step beacuse bad data may lead to unexpected results or misleading information

### Explore your data
- Try to find out if there are any interesting patterns or corelations
- Kind of like a secondary sanitary check
- Use basic statistical methods or visualization
  - No machine learning or anything yet
- Try to build some familiarity with your data

### Build a model
- Make predictions based on your model
- Train the model using the training/historical data

### Interpretation
- You need to be able to interpret your data for others who aren't as technically knowledgeable
- Derive insights and make policy decisions if needed
- Convince people about a certain standpoint

# Potential Careers in Data Science
- Data engineers
  - Gather and store data
  - Extract, transform, and load datasets for further analysis by other people
- Data scientists
  - Use models and algorithms to extract meaningful insights
- Data analysts
  - Analyze datasets and create visualizations
  - Don't use modeling as much
- Business intelligence analysts
  - Knowledgeable about data related to finance and market transactions
  - Similar to data analysts
- Machine learning engineers
  - Specialize in machine learning models instead of statistical models
  - Focus on development of a model rather than interpretation
