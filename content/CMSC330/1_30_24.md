# Typing

- Typing/typing systems is determing what is the data and how it can be used
  - Typically language dependent
    - For instance, true and false are boolean in Java but int in C
- Type checking: to see if something is the correct type
  - Like if the type is legal
    - For instance &ing 2 ints
- Dynamic checking: when type checking is performed at run time
  - In Java, a kind of type checked at run time are polymorphic variables
    - Related to subclasses?
- Static typing: type checking is performed at compile time
  - Java does this too
- Manifest (explicit) typing: when we explicity tell the compiler the type of the variable
  - Ex. **int** x = 2
  - Types are associated with variables meaning variables are assigned types and must remain that type until later changed
- Latent (implicit) typing: compiler interprets the variable type and we don't give it
  - Ex. y = True
  - You can change the type implicitly too
  - Ex.
  
```python
y = True
y = "hello"
```
   
# Fuctional Programming

- Functional programming - a programming paradigm based on functions
  - Paradigm - a view, a way of understanding, pattern, example
  - Programming paradigm - classification of programming approach, based behavior of code
    - Think about it like a langauge features
    - Many languages have a lot of overlap for language features but they typically focus on different things
- Language shapes the way we see and think about reality
  - For instance, if we have a language that does not allow for or while loops, you're gonna start thinking in recursion
- Function - takes an input, gives an output
- Functional langauges
  - Features include
    - Immutable state - once you assign a variable a value, you cannot update it
      - State - what variables exist and what are their values, the state of the machine
    - Declaractive programming - focus on what we want to do, not how we do it (like how we use an implicit iterator(declarative prorgamming) in Java instead of actually writing out the entire iterator (imperative programming))
      - Imperative programming - typically allows for a mutable state that may be changing or destructive
      - Can cause side effects (things that we cannot consider/control)
    - Referential transparency - replacing something with an equivalent output
      - No referential transparency - replaces expression with value with no side effects

# Functions and Expressions

- Everything in ocaml are expressions
  - Expressions - computations/evaluations, not assigned to a value
  - All values are expressions but not vice versa
    - 3 is an expression and a value
    - 1+3 is an expression but not a value
- Expressions have types denoted by t
  - We say expression e has type t with:
  - e:t
    - Ex.
    - 3:int
    - true:bool
- More complex expressions are like if expressions
  - So it will evaluate down to a value and it has a type
  - Works the same so if something is true- > do something, if false -> do something else
  - The **value** that the if expression evaluates to is the outcome, the do something part
  - The **type** of the if expression depends on the types of the outcomes
  - There will always be an else oart
  - Syntax:

```ocaml
if expression1 then expression2 else expression3
```

- expression1 **must** be type bool
  - expression1:bool
- expression2 and expression3 can be anything (**as long as they are the same type**)
  - expression2:t
  - expression3:t
- the overall if expression is thus of type t (which depends on expression 2 and 3)
  - (if expression1:bool then expression2:t else expression3:t):t

```ocaml
1+ (if (if true then false else true) then 3 else 4)
```
- This is a perfectly legal expression
- Expressions can be nested into other
  - Parentheses are optional



# Extra

```ocaml
(* hello.ml *) (* this is a comment *)
print_string "hello world\n"
```

Initial observations
- comments are writen between (* *)
- escape characters are still used in strings
- strings still use quotation marks
- spaces in functions are still denoted with an underscore and are all lowercase
- arguments are not denoted with ()
- no semicolons
- there is a specific print string function, meaning there may be other kind of print functions
- No main function or class
- Don't have to import anything for printing
- Files are read as .ml (metalanguage class)
- OCaml is a compiled language
  - Must be compiled then executed

### Compiling
```
ocamlc file_name.ml
```
- Compile using ocamlc
- Will produce an a.out file, file_name.cmi file, and a file_name.cmo file
- Run it using:

```
./a.out
```
- .cmi files are compiled interfaces
- .cmo files are compiled object
- dont' worry about them


- We're probably going to use dune instead of ocamlc

### Testing

- You can test simple line of codes using
```
ocaml
```
or
```
utop
```
- utop is just a more user friendly GUI than ocaml
- add double semicolons after a line and press enter to execute it
  - double semicolons end a line
  - if you don't include it, it'll just think you're not done

```ocaml
print_string "hello world";;
```
